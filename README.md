# Resizable-web-page

Build a simple HTML-CSS-Javascript structure with resizable aside and section.

The page is made of:
- **header**
- **aside**
- **section**
- **footer**

The border of the `aside` block is draggable horizontally and it resizes the `aside` and `section` `width`.

The proportion percentage of `aside` is saved into a cookie, so the page reload will not lose the settings.

`aside` and `section` has a fixed `height` and they scroll vertically indipendently each other.
